Noticed shortcomings of sax:
- assumes gaussian distribution of time series (TS), thus the TS has to be stationary, i.e. seasonality and trend
factors have to be removed
- there seems to be a need of data normalization into a [0, 1]^d domain, which to an exent might defeat the purpose of
scalability (e.g. online learning or stream processing tasks)


TODO:
- add DFT transform
- write report
- tangle with tree based breakpoint, symbol and distance matrix representation
