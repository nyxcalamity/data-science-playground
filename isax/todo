Noticed shortcomings of sax:
- assumes gaussian disribution of time series (TS), thus the TS has to be stationary, i.e. seasonality and trend factors have to be removed
- there seems to be a need of data normalization into a [0, 1]^d domain, which to an exent might defeat the purpose of scalability (e.g. online learing or stream processing tasks)
