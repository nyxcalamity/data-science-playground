SAX Acquaintance
====
A simplistic comparison of SAX and discrete Fourier transformation data reduction techniques on a synthetic time series that demonstrated main ideas behind both methods and provides a UI for interactive investigation of various parameters. A detailed description is provided in the [report].

### Goals
- get acquainted with SAX and iSAX data reduction

### Data
For the purposes of this project a simple random walk with Gaussian distribution
for random number generator was implemented.

### Tools and dependencies
- python `3.4.3`
- numpy `1.11.1`
- scipy `0.18.0`
- matplotlib `1.5.2`

### How to run
```
# example usage on linux
$python3.4 scripts/main.py
```

### Results and insights
Please, see the conclusions section of the [report].
